DB = C:\temp\MTQ

=====================
In Cameron TIMS, we add two more category. The current application features are the same for both categories.
> Equipment
> Gauges

Equipment can be anything. See the ALL lifting gear.xlsx file attached. Follow the structure for DB.

We need forms for Add, edit, delete, and report for expiring equipment’s. 
Report is just a list expiring items from selected start and end dates.
 

Gauges, follow the Master list attached from two different locations. Follow the structure for DB.

Additionally add status column with the following options:


 Sent for Calibration - Blue
 Due for Calibration - Not yet Sent = Yellow
 Scrap = Red
 On Hold = Orange
